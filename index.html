			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>
			<p><b>Why did you do Ironhack?</b></p>
				There is one thing that gives me more “stamina” than coffee: challenges. In this journey of solving problems my first step was looking for a human-centered methodology that included the importance of listening and provided the tools I needed to become the expert that I want to become.
				Therefore when I discovered UX/UI design I wanted to enjoy the ironhack bootcamp because it’s a method that fills the gap between problems/people needs and product/solutions. For personal reasons, this method is the net that link everything that fulfills me: people, tech, challenges, investigation, creativity and innovation. 
			<p><b>What do you look for in a company culture?</b></p>
				In a company I want to feel that I'm part of a larger common goal where people are engaged to be part of a larger purpose. 
				I look for a company culture that provides employees with a sense of safety and well-being and has a policy where everyone 
				looks out for each other. For last, a place where employees feel their voices can be heard when they aren’t muffled under layers of management.	
			<p><b>Superpower & why?</b></p>
				My superpower is empathy because it permits me to escape the limits of my own life 
				and enter in the world of another human being, understanding the depth of their 
				feelings and thoughts.

					<h2>Agathe Pommery, <br> Lead Teacher Ironhack</h2>
					<p>“Bárbara is a quiet force. She has a very clear overview of the Design Process and she is a very good listener. Despite the fact that she knows already a lot about empathy, human-centered process and techniques, she still embraces the tools and the learnings with a beginner's mindset.
							Bárbara is always thinking and bringing the project back to the user. She is great at pivoting when necessary, and keeps the team focused with her time management skills. She is a team-player who brings a lot of resources to her teams and peers who respect and appreciate her very much.
							Bárbara is on her way to be a great designer.”</p>

					<h2>Marco Regalado, <br> Co-Worker </h2>
					<p>“I had the opportunity to work with Barbara for about 1 year. There are several reasons to recommend your work: excellent professional, technically very competent, outstanding workability,, responsible and dedicated. The barbarian is a goal oriented person, conveying great confidence in her work, she is the person who is part of the solution, not the problem.
							Barbara is a professional with far above average research and training skills. With a knowledge of several areas of study, with an integrated vision, she is a dedicated professional and available to work in teams, undoubtedly an unquestionable added value in any work project and any company. In all the projects in which she has been involved, Barbara has always made valuable contributions to their development.”

					<h2>Carlos Robledo, Classmate</h2>
					<p>“I’ve worked with Barbara in personal projects in UX/UI. She's always been a guide and mentor when it comes to User research. She's a quite and respectful leader able to communicate effectively the next steps for a Design thinking methodology; in her own words, "Trust the process". 
							Everyone in the team refers to her when in trouble, doubt or when having any blockers on the methodology. Her main ability is being able to keep calm and take this calm to the rest of the team, while keeping them focused on the problem to be solved.
							I'd definitely consider hiring Barbara as a UX designer, not only for her soft skills, but also for her past experience in working as a UX researcher, empathising with the users in such a respectful way.”</p>
